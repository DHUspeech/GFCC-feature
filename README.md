# GFCC-feature
A novel feature to do speech anti-spoofing/playback speech detection

Objective
--------------------------------------------
Literature shows that graph signal processing (GSP) shows a better correlation between speech samples and explore more hidden information from speech than the traditional digital signal processing methods. With this motivation, we propose a novel feature based on GSP, namely, graph frequency cepstral coefficient
(GFCC) to detect playback speech.
